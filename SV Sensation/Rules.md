Watches don’t only happen at night – they begin as soon as we set sail.

Each watch lasts 3 hours.

The person on watch must wake the skipper at the slightest doubt – whether it’s a potential collision, or a change in wind direction or strength.

No one handles manoeuvres alone during their watch.

Clipping in is mandatory on deck at all times – no exceptions during passages.
