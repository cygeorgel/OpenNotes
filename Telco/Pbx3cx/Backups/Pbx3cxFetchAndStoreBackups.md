# Pbx3cx Fetch and Store Backups

## Overview

The project employs a collection of bash scripts tailored to address the specific backup needs of 3CX resellers, especially as the number of 3CX hosts continues to grow. By locally generating backups on 3CX hosts and transferring them securely to designated storage, this solution ensures data integrity and accessibility while simplifying the backup management process.
