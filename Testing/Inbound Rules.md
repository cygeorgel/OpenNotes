Type and number should be grouped together, either on the same row or on the same column.

It would be nice it the title "Number" was automatically changed by the choice of type.

Message "DID number is already used by an active rule" : then it should not be shown in the list.

Error messages refer to "call queue" : they should be changed in order to reflect the change from "call queue" to "inbound rule"

It would ne nice to have a margin between content and borders.
