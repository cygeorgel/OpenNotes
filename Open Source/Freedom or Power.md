SUMMARY:
"Freedom or Power?" by Bradley M. Kuhn and Richard M. Stallman discusses the distinction between freedom and power within the context of software development, advocating for user freedoms over the power of developers to impose restrictions through proprietary licenses.

IDEAS:
- The essence of liberty involves prioritising the well-being of others over personal gain.
- Free software movement champions freedoms essential for a collaborative and cooperative community.
- Freedom is equally important for both programmers and non-programmers.
- The choice of software license impacts the balance between freedom and power.
- Confusing power with freedom undermines the pursuit of genuine liberty.
- Proprietary software, by nature, exercises power over users, limiting their freedoms.
- The control proprietary developers have over software can lead to direct harm to users.
- The ethical stance of the free software movement is not inherently anti-business.
- The broader societal impact of software extends beyond the interests of developers alone.
- The concept of "code as law" emphasises the importance of who controls the software we use.
- The GNU General Public License aims to empower users by ensuring their control over software usage.
- The growing awareness of "code as law" is leading more users to value their software freedoms.

QUOTES:
- "The love of liberty is the love of others; the love of power is the love of ourselves."
- "Freedom is being able to make decisions that affect mainly you; power is being able to make decisions that affect others more than you."
- "Making a program proprietary is an exercise of power."
- "A choice of masters is not freedom."
- "If 'code is law,' then the real question we face is: who should control the code you useâ€”you, or an elite few?"
- "We believe you are entitled to control the software you use."
- "Current copyright law places us in the position of power over users of our code, whether we like it or not."
- "The ethical response to this situation is to proclaim freedom for each user."
- "The GNU General Public License is for: it puts you in control of your usage of the software while protecting you from others who would like to take control of your decisions."
- "As more and more users realise that code is law, and come to feel that they too deserve freedom."

HABITS:
- Advocating for user freedoms in software development.
- Rejecting proprietary licenses that restrict user freedoms.
- Promoting collaboration and cooperation within the software community.
- Educating others about the distinction between freedom and power in software usage.
- Supporting the development and use of free software.
- Engaging in ethical practices that prioritize user control over software.
- Utilizing the GNU General Public License to protect user freedoms.

FACTS:
- The free software movement focuses on freedoms necessary for a good way of life.
- Proprietary software often denies users the ability to understand, modify, or share it.
- Most people now use computers and software, giving developers significant control over many aspects of life.
- The GNU General Public License aims to ensure users maintain control over their software usage.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Embrace free software to ensure your freedoms as a user.
- Avoid proprietary software that restricts your ability to understand, modify, or share it.
- Support the free software movement's principles in your own software development practices.
- Educate others about the importance of user control over software.
- Use licenses like the GNU General Public License to protect user freedoms in your own projects.
